This project consists of the following bits and pieces:

  * A proposed specification to add support for embedded color image
    glyphs in OpenType fonts,

  * A tool called emoji_builder.py, to embed a set of PNG images into
    an existing font,

  * Two sets of sample PNG images for ASCII characters and sample
    scripts to build them into test fonts: FruityGirl and Funkster.

  * Scripts to build a real color emoji font out of the Open Source
    PhantomOpenEmoji images.
